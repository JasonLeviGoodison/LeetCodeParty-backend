# Leetcode Party

## Running Server

    make run

## Setting up

### PostgreSQL DB
[Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/)  and install PostgreSQL

Create a new database, which can be done using the following psql commands in your terminal:

```
psql
CREATE DATABASE leetparty;

```

Keep track of this database name (leetparty), you will need to add this to the new secrets file.

_Side Note: I also am a pretty big fan of this  [GUI representation app](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)  of a your psql databases. Feel free to use it to visualize your data a bit easier_
